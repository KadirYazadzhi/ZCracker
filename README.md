```

## 🎯 Features
- 🔥 **Multi-threaded processing**: Utilizes all available CPU cores for high-speed brute forcing.
- ⚡ **Asynchronous execution**: Ensures smooth operation without UI freezing.
- 📂 **Supports large password lists**: Optimized for high-speed processing of up to **100,000 passwords**.
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform**: Works on both Windows and Linux.

## 🛠️ Installation
### 📌 Prerequisites
- ✅ .NET 6.0 or later
- ✅ Windows or Linux operating system
- ✅ ZIP files compressed using standard encryption

### 📥 Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/7cracker.git
   cd 7cracker
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

## 📌 Usage
1. **Run 7Cracker**
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```
2. **Enter the required paths:**
   - 📁 Path to the target ZIP archive.
   - 📄 Path to the password list file.
3. 🚀 The program will attempt to extract the archive using all passwords from the provided list.

### ⚠️ Important Limitations
❗ **The password file must contain fewer than 100,000 entries.**
- 🚫 Larger files may cause excessive memory usage, leading to system crashes or slowdowns.
- 🔄 Consider splitting larger files into smaller chunks.

## ⚡ Performance
- 🔹 **10,000 passwords**: ~4 seconds
- 🔹 **50,000 passwords**: ~10-12 seconds
- 🔹 **100,000 passwords**: ~25-30 seconds
- 🔴 **Over 100,000 passwords**: ❌ **NOT SUPPORTED (May cause instability)**
